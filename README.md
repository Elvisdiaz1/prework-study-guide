# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was made for the purposes of understanding HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Git conceptally and mechanically.
I built this project to gain pratice on how to use these programs and to act as a study for me and anybody else who needs a reminder.
The problems this project solves are creating a html, css, and javascript file for learning uses as well as allowing us to learn how to use git and github.
What I learned from doing this project was how to use HTML, Javascript, CSS, the Terminal, Git, and Github.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
This study guide project can be used for getting reminders on any of the four sections and can be possibly updated to include more notes in the future. Each section talks a specific program and contains notes about that program exculsively.
The project also contains a file for CSS and another file for Javascript, allowing one to go into the browser's devtools and inspect some of the inner workings of the project. You can play with the css settings by inspecting what portion is affected with what setting and can even change it in the devtools to see what would happen if you remove a setting or change it completely. With the javascript file, you can use the devtools to go into the console and see some functions processing correctly, with a random function also in play which allows you to reload the page and get a different result each time (unless you get the luck of the draw and get the same answer multiple times in a row).
